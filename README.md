The purpose of this file is to hold the code nessesary for Team Lizst's Grid Friendly Device (GFA). Using an MSP430f2618 the team will
attempt to calculate frequency, RMS voltage, RMS current and phase shift. Currently only frequency is working but is off by about -3Hz.
CodeComposer Studio is used to program the MSP430 and TeraTerm is used to display data across the UART.
